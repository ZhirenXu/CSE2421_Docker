# CSE2421_Docker  
Build a standard container that fits the need to CSE2421 in Ohio State University  

## Motivation
   Since few are happy about the slow remote access to stdlinux, I think using Docker to build a stable Linux environment for coding C/Assembly in this class will be a good idea.
   In that way, everything will be localized, no network glitch and server down time. I spent a few days in it and get it done! 

## How-to
   There is a detailed instruction on how to set up everything from scratch. Open Docker_stdlinux_setup.pdf and follow its instruction.  
    
   You can also use "docker push zhirenxu/ubuntu_stdlinux:tagname" in docker to pull image directly from docker hub.  
   
   There is a free book available for OSU student. "Beginning DevOps with Docker", OSU library has free online access of it.
